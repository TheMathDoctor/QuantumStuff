# QuantumStuff
I show how to build the circuit for the quantum Fourier transform and the inverse quantum Fourier transform in IBM's qiskit. I also show how to prepare the GHZ states on IBM's qiskit and for the case when d=2, I prepare the Bell state on IBMQ_5_Yorktown and measure the state's entropy of entanglement and entanglement number.
